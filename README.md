# Star Wars RPG

Cracks in the multi-verse have opened up, allowing characters from the original Star Wars trilogy to face off with Force-wielders from the era of the First Order. With this violation of the rules of time and space, old alliances are forgotten. It's every man for himself. (You too, Rey.)

Choose from four characters and then see if you can defeat the other three. With every attack, you will grow stronger! But will it be enough to keep you alive?
